# ~~~~

# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.
# If you deploy your application to several instances be sure to use the same key!

# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
